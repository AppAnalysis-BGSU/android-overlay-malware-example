# Android Malware Example

Harmless Android malware using the overlay technique to steal user credentials.

Created to show how the [Android Overlay Protector](http://www.overlayprotector.com/) app can detect such attacks.

> **UPDATE** starting with Android 5.1 the [ActivityManager.getRunningAppProcess](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.html#getRunningAppProcesses) API don't return all processes running on the system anymore. We moved to Usage Stats API which requires the user to enable this permission manually. If you want to test on this version you need to enable the application via Settings -> Security -> Apps with usage access

## Disclamier
This software is intended to sensitize users to this kind of attacks.
Don't use it for any other purposes!
