# Android Malware Example

Harmless Android malware using the overlay technique to steal user credentials.

> **UPDATE** starting with Android 5.1 the [ActivityManager.getRunningAppProcess](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.html#getRunningAppProcesses) API don't return all processes running on the system anymore. We moved to a more *naive* solution which doesn't require any permissions, for more information [press here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30619349/android-5-1-1-and-above-getrunningappprocesses-returns-my-application-packag).

## Disclamier
This software is intended to sensitize users to this kind of attacks.
Don't use it for any other purposes!

## Quick Start
In the main screen you can select which application are going to be overlayed (currently between Linkedin, Skype, and UBS Mobile App).
Furthermore you can choose the type of overlay between:
* View overlay with `WindowsManager.addView`
* Activity overlay with `startActivity`

The application has been tested on Nexus 5 with Android 6 (Real device) and Nexus 5X with Android 4.4.2 (Emulator).
